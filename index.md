Hello. My name is Varya, and my talk is about -- surprise! -- design systems. However, I will keep it very practical. I
would like to show how we could use our developers' knowledge and ability to code and apply it to the domain of design
systems. Using certain technologies, we can build not only the interface components but also infrastucture and tools for
our design system to run.

First, a few words about myself. Design Systems has been my major focus even before the buzzword appeared. I have nearly
15 years of experience in frontend development, mostly doing the things related to the components on the web. Back then
it was component solutions in CSS and JavaScript, later styleguides and pattern libraries, and nowadays
finally design systems. I worked on technical aspects of design systems in several projects and also did a lot of
team and project management in this field.
At the moment, I am self-employed expert in design systems.

<!--

Then, if we want this documentation in React-friendly format, we can automatically translate it with some script.
And after that, we simply run the tool over the gotten source.

This way, you don't have to change the way how you write your docs and you don't break the familiar process for your
people. But you already have Styleguidist in use.

Then, Styleguidist can be used as a playgorund for development or it can be customized as a documentation website.

Also, consider this automation as a small step towards new technologies. One day they will come to your project as well.
By that time you already have some set up for the tools.

}

</style>

<!--

Why is it all needed and why did I start to speak about that?

Recently I saw this funny tweet. Let's run it in a separate window. In here we can see a designer updating their design
libraries. The tweet if funny but the situation it reffers to is scary. And sad. And true.

Oftern happens, that translating design to development is organized on a low technical level and so there is a lot of
waste work. This is especially noticable if we need to provide a bucnh of small changes across the whole product.
Then we do work as the video shows.

## React <b>= friendly environment and tools</b>
{: .friendly }

* Development playground
* Autogenerated docs
* <b>Plugins</b>

<style>

.friendly h2 b {
  font-size: 0.8em;
  display: block;
  color: #38bcc2;
}

</style>

<!--

I think that React can help us here. By using tools from its ecosystem we offer the team different automations which
make the design and development process smoother. It is much easier for people to contribute into a library if
everything works automatically. By using the tools you can offer coding designers a friendly environment and so close the gap
between specializations. Non-coding designers can soon participate as well since they see how smooth and beneficial
the process is.

Once we have such a system working, the next step would be applying different plugins. Which plugins â€” depends on your
specific needs but I give you one example.

-->


## This is CSS
{: .no-title .this-is-css }

![](pictures/css1.jpg){: .meme}

<style>
.this-is-css {
  text-align: center;
}
.this-is-css .meme {
  height: 500px;
}
</style>

<!--

Everything depends on the problem we are trying to solve. This picture is about CSS, there are dozens of them in the
internet. Yeah, CSS can bring us such surprises.
Editting something we can break the things in some other place. So, its is much recommended to have some automated
visual regression tests  and run them regularly.

-->


## Visual regression tests
{: .vr-tests }

![](pictures/spot-difference.png)

<style>
.vr-tests {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>

<!--

This picture I often show to illustrate what sometimes our job looks like when not having visual regression tests.
Indeed, sometimes when providing changes we do need to check very carefuly what else has changed. It might be
time-consuming, not creative or interesting thing at all, and very inefficient.

But thanks to the existing tooling, we can have
visual regression tests for your components quite nicely and without much pain.

-->


## Visual regression tests
{: .slide--center .vr-tests-2 .no-title }

![](pictures/visual-regression-diff.png){: .image }

#### with Styleguidist or Storybook
### Get visual tests with one `npm install`

<style>

.vr-tests-2 .slide__content {
  text-align: center;
}

.vr-tests-2 .image {
  height: 350px;
}

</style>

<!--

I have a lot of experience with custom set ups. They served the purpose but took much more time to maintain. So, I think
it is always better to re-use the community work and adopt the common solution.

Both Styleguidist and Storybook have additional plugins for visual regression tests, sometimes more than one. With that
plugins, the set up is just installing one more npm package. And since the whole interface is already divided into
isolated components, running the tests is easy.

Combining this idea with generating documenttaion from custom source, you can take advantage of the plugins even for
non-React projects.

This is
not only about visual tests. If we generalize the idea, we can think about using React ecosystem for non-React projects.

## Style Guide <b>vs</b> Design System
{: .style-guide_design-system .slide--shout .slide--primary-light }

![](pictures/icons/design-thinking/web-design.svg){: .svg .image }

<style>
.style-guide_design-system b {
  text-transform: lowercase;
}

.style-guide_design-system .image {
  width: 250px;
}
</style>

<!--

Now, let's recollect that design system is not only a library. Style guide is a necessary thing to have when
communicating your design system. But it's not the only thing. What we can implement for the design systems if consider
them in wider perspective?

-->


## Design systems - connecting people

if we are speaking about larger organization.

So, the role of a design system is to create environment such a collaboration.

![](pictures/icons/user-experience/007-validation.svg){: .svg .image }

.single-point .image {
  width: 250px;
}
</style>

<!--

Design system itself is a "Single Point of Thurth", a place, a tool a thing which communicates you how to build and
maintain the products. This single point of truth needs proper representation, something real, from where people of
different specializations get the information they need.

<!--

Let's have a look what people of different specializations need from a design system.

Developers mostly see design systems as libraries. They would like to have documentation for every component, examples
of usage and maybe explanation of the implementation details.
Also, they are interested in general information such as release notes, instructions how to contribute, and so on.

Designers also need documentation for every pattern, especially the reasons behind them. They need to know how to
create new patterns and so they require related infromation.

Project managers or owners are interested in the design system's nearest future or, in particular, what new components
are going to be released and what are the upcoming changes to the existing ones.

People on buisness levels of the company would like to have a larger scale picture,
maybe even with numbers of how much design system costs and how much we save when using it.

A style guide website which documents the components cannot be such a place but only a part of it. Style guide
communicates how to use existing patterns. But we should also know how to make new patterns, how to provide brand
changes, what are the design and development processes and so on. There should be a website which contains all this
information.

At the same time, it's good to take advantange of the technologies. So, it dictates the technical solution behind the website.
It can be whatever you as a developer are comfortable with. My own experience was with GatsbyJS.
Gatsby has a lot of plugins and it is quite easy to
write your owns. So, it is very flexible and can easily respond your organization needs. I can show you some things I
implemented with it, but beware there is no limits.

## How Gatsby works
{: .gatsby-basics .slide--full-image }

  color: grey;
}

</style>

<!--

Just to put you into context, this is a schema of how Gatsby processes data. It's very approximate since Gatsby is very
flexible. But the main thing here is that you can provide different sources in whatever formats. It can be data from CMS
or data from markdown files on the file system, or data grabbed from third party services. Gatsby combines this all
together and at the website you can have an access to it via GraphQL. Out of this data, Gatsby builds a static website.
Again, as a developer you can 100% control how this build happens.

In the case I am describing, the website was built based on markdown. It does not mean that this is a final version of
it. But for a developer, it was quite easy option to start with.

</style>

<!--

This is a source structure of Gatsby website I was workinng with. Basically, the website
had a structure of pages and one of the sections is blog. You can see that the pages and blog posts are stored in
folders where there are markdown files. Once built, it goes onto the website as corresponding web pages.

The structure I am showing here is not something I recommend for every design system to have. It is just an example of a
very simple website. When developing real design system website, every company should set up their own custom
structure.

## React components in texts

}

</style>

<!--

As I said, Gatsby has a lot of plugins. One of them makes it possible to use your React components in markdown texts.
When renddered, you have a React component functioning in the browser. It requres to list all the components you are
going to have, but overall it is possible.

This way you
can get React components from your library and describe them in a very flexible way on pages. A designer can write a
text an illustrate it with the component.

<!--

There are different ways to put React components onto the pages. Another one is using MDX, Gatsby has a plugin for this
as well. This option looks even nicer. We can automatically list all the components from the library and this will make
them available at our documentaion pages.

Even if your components are not in React but let's say in plain HTML/CSS, you
still can provide generic React interface for them, similar to how it was done for usign Styleguidist or Storybook.
This will simplify writing the documentation and also smoothly teach non-React people how beuatiful React is.
Constrantly, they shift their mind from HTML snippets to React tags, and this will help with adopting the technology all
over the company, if you need this.

TODO: rewrite text

We can alo make custom components. They are not from your library but whatever else. Here only your fantacy can
limit you. This way you create interactive documentation. Here are some examples from my experience:
* Pattern Journey
* Changelog (but later we did it differently)
* Cartoon about flow

Such components make plain documentation more interesing to read. We can consider this as entertaining the people. But
in fact, even if it is a cartoon, it is a very serious thing valid for the business. Such interactive documentation
solves the problem of information availability. Which means, it serves to connecting people and providing information.

## Interactive changelog?

For example, we can renpresent changelogs of the libraries. In GitHub they are stored as static pieces of text which is not super
convinient when our fellow developers want to upgrade through many versions. We can improve GitHub flow and based on the
extracted data make some kind of interactive changelog. This again smooths the learning curve and makes things easier
for the people. I remind you that being user-friendly is one of the most important things in design systes, because it's a service!

## One single point of truth
{: .deps-info }

### Extract info from packages and repos

<div class="double" markdown="1">

Make your design system website a place where all the info can be found at any time.<br/>
<b>Display markdown from libraries, tools and related repositories on the website pages.</b>

![](pictures/icons/office-set/business-affiliate-network.svg){: .svg .connection }

</div>

<style>

.deps-info .connection {
  width: 300px;
}

</style>

<!--

Being one single point of truth, it is good if the design system website gets data from different sources and shows it
at the page.

For example, if there is several libraries, you can have them as dependencies and get their Readme description as a
markdown. This markdown can again be a source of the corresponding pages of the website. This way, your users do not
need to surf the GitHub to get infromation about the libraries. They have everything needed at the website.

The process of extracting these data can be automated. So that when a new version is released, we re-build the pages.

<!--

There are different governance models for design systems.
Sometimmes there is a dedicated team for its development, sometimes the whole process goes spontaniously. But in all the
cases community work is welcomed.
Contribution to documentation or sharing
the ideas is also very crucial. At the end of the day, no one else but design system users know it from users'
perspective.

In order to involve the community into the Design System project, give them as much way to contribute as possible. Here
again the Gatsby choice and hosting the source on GitHub helps a lot. It can be GitHub Entreprise, but with access for
all the employees.

We allow people to propose their text or code changes. If it is via GitHub pull requests, it is quite safe as still is
reviewed by the team. But very important that all the colleagues, anyone of them feels a bit as an owner of the project.
Smart books call it "emotional ownership", so don't skip this aspect.

There is a bit of learning curve for non-technical people here. But not so large, they don't have to make any fork. Just
provide a link to editting via GitHub interface and it's done. The pull requests can come as patches.

This definetely speeds up the process, plays a large role in keeping the docs up-to-date and in general makes the design
system *alive*.

And a little tip here. If everything is editted with GitHub, we can alanyze the source history and get the names of all
the contributors. It pays respect for people's work and I'm sure it is very pleasing to see yourself in the list.

Secondary, it helps
people to communicate. They can see whom to ask about specific things.

The contribution usually starts from a small thing like fixing a typo. But once people realize that they can easily
operate the tools, they get no limits. And this helps us to solve the problems we are focused on. Which I believe is rarely
something technical but most often people problems.

By providing a place which is single point of truth for a design system, we can connect people. We can help them to
start a dialog and to collaborate.

One of the tools for such people interaction would be blogging.

As a design system representatives, we can ourselves provide a lot of information in blog format. For example,
announcements of what has been implemented. We can also speak about the future describing plans and strategies. Blogging
is less strict format, it makes people much comfortable to give the feedback. So, such plans can be altered by this
feedback. Here the in-house design and development community is already involved.

They can also themselves write posts into such a blog. As long as everyone in the organization has access to the
design systems website repository, they can write they own markdown texts and create pull requests with the new content.

If makrdown sounds too technical and not so much welcoming, you can use other sources. For example, not everyone finds
blogging experience nice with Makrdown. Then, you can offer them familiar solution, maybe Wordpress? With Gatsby, you
can get data from there and still represent it on the website. This way, Wordpress acts like a CMS. If it destroys
barriers, then it's definitely a solution to go.

This is especially interesting for measuring the impact of design systems. It is another huge topic which we cannot
fully cover right now. But here is a bunch of ideas for it.

We can crawl the repositories to calculate the usage of components. It works for React componets and for CSS classes.
Similarly, we analyse dependencies in `package.json` at the projects and so we can learn the versions used. This way,
we can measure how much our libraries are used. Also, we know our users better, who uses what. When providing changes
to the libraries, we can contact people who are using specific components.

## Crawling the repositories to calculate the usage of components
This is more about measuring the impact of design systems, which is another huge topic. BTW, I am very much in it right
now and if you would like to have a chat about it, please welcome to speak after the talk or in social networks. But
again, from automation perrspective, if all the projects are in some repositories, let's say on GitHub Enterprise, wee
can crawl repos and calculate the usage of components. Works for React components and for re-use of CSS classes.
Similarly, we analyse dependencies in `package.json` at the projects and so we can learn the versions used.

Links: to the usage of the components

Most metrics cannot show much on their own but are more valuable in dynamics. As design system is usually not a solid
product but constansly evolving thing (I would even say it's a process), we would like to "measure" that we are doing
better not worse. For a human being, it's much more readable as a chart of graph. So, we can store gathered information
and represent it on the weebsite as a chart component. TODO: Give examples.

As I mentioned, design system is a service and when providing tooling around it, you should consider your fellow
developers and the users. Service design offers methods to develop new ideas and sharp the services for the users. Like,
user-centred design etc. The ideas presenetd above were very much developed based on propoper user research which I made
with my colleagues on existing design system. Usign similar methods, you can develop your own ideas or combine with the
presented and shape your design system up to the needs of your company and projects.
